# Music Prediction Code Explanation


## 1st Block

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

The code is used to mount Google Drive in a Google Colab notebook. Google Colab is a cloud-based platform that allows us to run and write code using Jupyter notebooks.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Import Library and Mount Drive**:
   - `from google.colab import drive`: Imports the "drive" module from the "google.colab" library.
   - `drive.mount('/content/drive')`: Mounts your Google Drive at the specified location '/content/drive' within the Colab environment.

2. **Mounting Google Drive**:
   - When you run `drive.mount('/content/drive')`, it initiates a process where you will be prompted to click on a link.
   - This link directs you to an authentication page where you need to sign in to your Google account (if you're not already signed in) and allow access to your Google Drive.
   - After granting access, you'll be provided with an authorization code.

3. **Authorize and Mount Drive in Colab**:
   - You paste the authorization code into the provided input box in the Colab notebook and press Enter.
   - The Colab environment then uses this code to authenticate and establish a connection between your Colab notebook and your Google Drive account.
   - Your Google Drive is now mounted, and you can access your files and directories from within your Colab notebook at the specified location ('/content/drive').

By mounting your Google Drive, you can easily access and work with files and data stored in your Google Drive directly from your Colab notebook, allowing for seamless integration and collaboration between Google Drive and the Colab environment.


## 2nd Block

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

#read file
music_data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/music.csv')
X=music_data.drop(columns=['genre'])
y=music_data['genre']

model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X,y)


predictions = model.predict([ [21,1], [22, 0], [50, 0] ])
predictions
```

This code is written in Python and involves using the Pandas library to read and manipulate data and the scikit-learn library to create and use a decision tree classifier for a music genre classification task.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - `import pandas as pd`: Imports the Pandas library and aliases it as "pd" for easier usage.
   - `from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier`: Imports the DecisionTreeClassifier class from the scikit-learn (sklearn) library.

2. **Read Data**:
   - `music_data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/music.csv')`: Reads a CSV file named "music.csv" from the specified path ('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/') into a Pandas DataFrame called "music_data".

3. **Prepare Data**:
   - `X = music_data.drop(columns=['genre'])`: Creates a feature matrix "X" by dropping the 'genre' column from the "music_data" DataFrame.
   - `y = music_data['genre']`: Creates a target variable "y" containing the 'genre' column from the "music_data" DataFrame.

4. **Create and Train the Model**:
   - `model = DecisionTreeClassifier()`: Creates an instance of a Decision Tree classifier.
   - `model.fit(X, y)`: Fits the decision tree model using the features (X) and the target variable (y).

5. **Make Predictions**:
   - `predictions = model.predict([[21, 1], [22, 0], [50, 0]])`: Uses the trained model to make predictions on three input samples: [21, 1], [22, 0], and [50, 0]. Each input sample represents age and a binary feature (1 or 0). The model predicts the genre for each sample.
   
6. **Display Predictions**:
   - `predictions`: Displays the predictions made by the model for the provided input samples.

The variable "predictions" will contain the predicted genres for the given input samples based on the trained decision tree model.


## 3rd Block

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split (X, y, test_size=0.2)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
prediction = model.predict(X_test)

score = accuracy_score(y_test, prediction)
score
```
This code is for training a machine learning model (presumably a decision tree classifier, given the previous usage of `model`), evaluating its performance, and calculating the accuracy score using scikit-learn (sklearn).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:
   - `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`: Imports the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn, which is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - `from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score`: Imports the `accuracy_score` function from scikit-learn, which is used to calculate the accuracy of the model's predictions.

2. **Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets**:
   - `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)`: Splits the features (X) and target labels (y) into training and testing sets. The `test_size=0.2` argument indicates that 20% of the data will be used for testing, and the remaining 80% will be used for training. The resulting sets are `X_train` (training features), `X_test` (testing features), `y_train` (training labels), and `y_test` (testing labels).

3. **Train the Model on the Training Set**:
   - `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`: Trains the model using the training features (`X_train`) and their corresponding labels (`y_train`).

4. **Make Predictions on the Testing Set**:
   - `prediction = model.predict(X_test)`: Uses the trained model to make predictions on the testing features (`X_test`), generating predicted labels.

5. **Calculate Accuracy**:
   - `score = accuracy_score(y_test, prediction)`: Calculates the accuracy score by comparing the predicted labels (`prediction`) with the actual labels for the testing set (`y_test`).

6. **Display the Accuracy Score**:
   - `score`: Displays the accuracy score, representing the proportion of correctly predicted labels in the testing set.

The `accuracy_score` helps evaluate the performance of the model by quantifying how well it predicts the labels for the unseen (testing) data. A higher accuracy score indicates a better-performing model.

## 4th Block

```python
from sklearn import tree
tree.export_graphviz(model, out_file='music-recommender.dot',
                     feature_names=['age', 'gender'],
                     class_names=sorted(y.unique()),
                     label='all',
                     rounded=True,
                     filled=True)
```
This code utilizes scikit-learn's `tree` module to export a decision tree model into a Graphviz DOT file, which can be used to visualize the decision tree.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:
   - `from sklearn import tree`: Imports the `tree` module from scikit-learn, which includes functions to work with decision trees.

2. **Export the Decision Tree to a DOT File**:
   - `tree.export_graphviz(model, out_file='music-recommender.dot', feature_names=['age', 'gender'], class_names=sorted(y.unique()), label='all', rounded=True, filled=True)`: Exports the decision tree model (`model`) to a Graphviz DOT file named 'music-recommender.dot'.
     - `model`: The trained decision tree model to be exported.
     - `out_file='music-recommender.dot'`: Specifies the output file name for the DOT file.
     - `feature_names=['age', 'gender']`: Specifies the feature names used in the tree visualization.
     - `class_names=sorted(y.unique())`: Specifies the class (genre) names for the tree visualization, sorted and obtained from the unique values in the target variable (`y`).
     - `label='all'`: Specifies to label all nodes in the decision tree.
     - `rounded=True`: Specifies to use rounded rectangles for decision nodes in the visualization.
     - `filled=True`: Specifies to fill decision nodes with colors based on the majority class.

The resulting 'music-recommender.dot' file contains the information needed to visualize the decision tree using Graphviz tools. This visualization helps in understanding how the decision tree is making predictions based on the provided features (age and gender).
