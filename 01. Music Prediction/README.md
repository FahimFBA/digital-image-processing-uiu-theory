# Music Prediction Code Explanation


## 1st Block

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

The code is used to mount Google Drive in a Google Colab notebook. Google Colab is a cloud-based platform that allows us to run and write code using Jupyter notebooks.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Import Library and Mount Drive**:
   - `from google.colab import drive`: Imports the "drive" module from the "google.colab" library.
   - `drive.mount('/content/drive')`: Mounts your Google Drive at the specified location '/content/drive' within the Colab environment.

2. **Mounting Google Drive**:
   - When you run `drive.mount('/content/drive')`, it initiates a process where you will be prompted to click on a link.
   - This link directs you to an authentication page where you need to sign in to your Google account (if you're not already signed in) and allow access to your Google Drive.
   - After granting access, you'll be provided with an authorization code.

3. **Authorize and Mount Drive in Colab**:
   - You paste the authorization code into the provided input box in the Colab notebook and press Enter.
   - The Colab environment then uses this code to authenticate and establish a connection between your Colab notebook and your Google Drive account.
   - Your Google Drive is now mounted, and you can access your files and directories from within your Colab notebook at the specified location ('/content/drive').

By mounting your Google Drive, you can easily access and work with files and data stored in your Google Drive directly from your Colab notebook, allowing for seamless integration and collaboration between Google Drive and the Colab environment.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

#read file
music_data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/music.csv')
X=music_data.drop(columns=['genre'])
y=music_data['genre']

model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X,y)


predictions = model.predict([ [21,1], [22, 0], [50, 0] ])
predictions
```

This code is written in Python and involves using the Pandas library to read and manipulate data and the scikit-learn library to create and use a decision tree classifier for a music genre classification task.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - `import pandas as pd`: Imports the Pandas library and aliases it as "pd" for easier usage.
   - `from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier`: Imports the DecisionTreeClassifier class from the scikit-learn (sklearn) library.

2. **Read Data**:
   - `music_data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/music.csv')`: Reads a CSV file named "music.csv" from the specified path ('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/') into a Pandas DataFrame called "music_data".

3. **Prepare Data**:
   - `X = music_data.drop(columns=['genre'])`: Creates a feature matrix "X" by dropping the 'genre' column from the "music_data" DataFrame.
   - `y = music_data['genre']`: Creates a target variable "y" containing the 'genre' column from the "music_data" DataFrame.

4. **Create and Train the Model**:
   - `model = DecisionTreeClassifier()`: Creates an instance of a Decision Tree classifier.
   - `model.fit(X, y)`: Fits the decision tree model using the features (X) and the target variable (y).

5. **Make Predictions**:
   - `predictions = model.predict([[21, 1], [22, 0], [50, 0]])`: Uses the trained model to make predictions on three input samples: [21, 1], [22, 0], and [50, 0]. Each input sample represents age and a binary feature (1 or 0). The model predicts the genre for each sample.
   
6. **Display Predictions**:
   - `predictions`: Displays the predictions made by the model for the provided input samples.

The variable "predictions" will contain the predicted genres for the given input samples based on the trained decision tree model.
